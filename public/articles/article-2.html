                    </div>
                    <p>At the outset of Covid-19, when trade and travel were restricted due to lockdowns, demand spiked sharply for some goods while dropping dramatically for others. In response, several businesses' top supply chain executives devised strategies for reorganising their supply networks. McKinsey observed that companies primarily worked to increase the supply chain's flexibility, agility, and resilience across regions. These are the significant reasons why supply chain management has gained much attention in recent years.</p>

                    <h2>Disruption and Shortage of Essential Commodities</h2>
                    <p>After the Covid 19 pandemic hit, most of the supply chain was blocked for multiple reasons. The primary reason was human resource shortage, which resulted in ports and warehouses in various countries coming to a complete halt and material flow throughout the entire global supply chain stopped. During the lockdown, the supply chain became a lifeline and support system for pharmaceutical, food and other vital necessities related companies to keep the flow of products when needed. When the economies restarted, major companies realised they had to modify their supply chains to provide goods and services quickly, safely and securely. The repurposed and reshaped supply chains need to be characterised by resilience and responsibility, especially on a global level, mainly due to multi-country disruption, which would help manage the crisis.</p>

                    <h2>Distribution of Vaccines</h2>
                    <p>As the entire globe wanted a vaccine to halt the pandemic, the shortcomings in the supply chains of many nations became a more significant concern. The Pfizer developed vaccine had to be maintained at ultra-cold temperatures (-60 to -90 degrees Celsius) for extended durations. In contrast, it could only be kept at a lesser temperature (-20 degrees Celsius) for a few weeks. This presented a difficulty for nations that lacked an Ultra cold storage supply chain. Before the pandemic, companies pushed for supply chain optimisation, digital transformation, and investment to reduce costs and increase productivity. But, although these factors remain important after the pandemic, the chaos caused by the pandemic that threatened their position in the market forced the companies to shift their focus from innovation and restructuring of the supply chain to ensure their business continuity and growth.</p>

                    <h2>Priority of Customers and Shift in Customer Demand</h2>
                    <p>There was a noticeable shift in consumer demand as the Covid 19 outbreak unfolded, with many people engaging in panic buying due to the crisis. Because of this, businesses couldn't use their usual ways of demand forecasting and instead had to come up with new approaches to keep up with customer needs. Nowadays, people love to buy products which are more personalised and customised. But the issue with satisfying such demands was a lack of flexibility in the supply chain. With increasing demands, companies revolving around such products have focused on their supply chain and modified it so they can satisfy these demands.</p>

                    <h2>Lessons from Semiconductor Chips Shortage</h2>
                    <p>In the wake of the pandemic, demand for personal cars dropped as people stayed indoors. This increased the demand for personal laptops, computers, gaming consoles, smartphones and smartwatches. This led to the semiconductor industry focusing more on the microchips used in these products than on the automobile industry. The industry encountered severe difficulties when vehicle demand began to rise, as semiconductor production facilities were already fully scheduled for as long as a year. This resulted in increased lead time for consumers buying automobiles (up to 6 months and a year). This again brought focus to poor supply chain management by the automobile industry and the automobile companies. The pandemic times have altered how the buyer-supplier relationship works. In certain industries, the failure of critical links in the supply chain has led to new alliances and co-development ventures between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers. The best example of this would be Ford and General Motors with chipmakers, where they formed a strategic agreement when it was predicted that there would be a shortage of semiconductors.</p>
                    <p>Recently, the prices of supply chains and operations have begun to climb at an alarming rate and can frequently represent a company's highest costs, which is highly detrimental to a company's sustainability. Companies have engaged in research surrounding supply chains and operations to address these issues and cut expenses.</p>
